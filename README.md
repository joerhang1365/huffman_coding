# how to execute
if you are using a unix system type this command into the directory of this project

chmod +x huffman_coding

afterwards type

./huffman_coding to execute the file

if you have make installed on your system you can just make the project and the file 
will automatically be exectuable

if you are on windows suck it
you will have to copy the source files and compile it on your own
